Git Merge:

git merge is a command that helps you integrate changes from another branch into your current branch. 
It combines the content of your current and target branches, 
and creates a new merge commit. 
This preserves the development context and history of both branches, 
but the commit history can become complex and hard to read, 
especially when many branches are involved.

git merge can be used with the --no-ff flag to prevent a fast-forward merge, 
which ensures a new commit is created even if it's not necessary, 
thus preserving the information that a merge occurred. 
Another useful flag is --squash, which combines all changes into a single new commit on the current branch.
