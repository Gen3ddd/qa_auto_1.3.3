Git Rebase:

git rebase is a command designed to integrate changes from one branch into another. 
Unlike git merge, which pulls the content of the target branch into the current branch, 
git rebase transfers the changes from the current branch onto the target branch. 
It creates a new "base" for your current branch by starting on the target branch 
and replaying the commits from your current branch on top of it. 
This results in a linear, cleaner commit history. 
However, it may rewrite the commit history, so it's generally not recommended for shared or public branches.

git rebase can be used with the -i or --interactive flag for an interactive rebase, 
which allows you to alter individual commits in the process. 
This is useful for cleaning up commit history by squashing, reordering, modifying, or dropping commits.
